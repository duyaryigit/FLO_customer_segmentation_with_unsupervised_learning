### Business Problem:

With Unsupervised Learning methods (Kmeans, Hierarchical Clustering), it is desired to divide customers into clusters and observe their behavior.

###  Dataset Story:

The dataset consists of information obtained from the past shopping behavior of customers who made their last purchases on OmniChannel (both online and offline) in 2020 - 2021.
